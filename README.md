## How To Play

Move the basket left and right with the Left and Right arrow keys, and try to catch as many falling candies as possible to get the high score.

## Local Setup

This project is currently setup to require a very minimal amount of tools to run the web application. The main tools that are needed are:

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment), or any program you can use to edit code.
  - In the video tutorial series linked above, I use the [Phaser Launcher](https://phaser.io/download/phaser-launcher).
- A local web server, this is needed due to browser security and how we are loading files with the Phaser 3 framework for our game.
  - You can use any local web server you are familiar with, however if you use [Phaser Launcher](https://phaser.io/download/phaser-launcher), this has a built in web sever.
